# SVG-Maker
Week 10


## Description
This is an SVG generator that uses JavaScript, Inquirer, and Jest. It allows users to create SVG logos by answering a few questions in the command line.

## Usage
To use this project, you can run the following command in your terminal:

node index.js
This will prompt you to answer a few questions about your logo: logo name, logo color, shape, and shape color. Once you have answered all of the questions, the SVG logo will be generated and saved to a file called logo.svg.
